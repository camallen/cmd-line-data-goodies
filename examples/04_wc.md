### Count words and more in a file / stream

Ever wondered how many words and or lines are in a file but never bothered to count them? Wonder no more with this nifty one liner.

Count the number of lines, words and characters in a file
```
wc data_files/deniro_rotten_tomato_scores.csv
```

Just the lines (see man page / below for more options)
```
wc -l data_files/deniro_rotten_tomato_scores.csv
```

Count the number of times Deniro has appeared a fockers movie
```
grep -i fockers data_files/deniro_rotten_tomato_scores.csv | wc -l
```

Useful options:
+ `wc -c` print the byte counts
+ `wc -m` print the character counts
+ `wc -w` print word counts
