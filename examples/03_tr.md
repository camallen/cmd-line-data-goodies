### Translating characters in a stream

Do not want to use commas to delimit columns in a file, i.e csv to tsv, use `tr` to make your life golden

Check the formatting from commas to tabs
```
head data_files/deniro_rotten_tomato_scores.csv | tr "," "\\t"
```

Convert a file and save a new one
```
head data_files/deniro_rotten_tomato_scores.csv | tr "," "\\t" > data_files/deniro_rotten_tomato_scores.tsv
```

Converting all upper case letters to lower case
```
cat README.md | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'
```

Word count a file using tr to replace punctuation and spaces with new lines and downcase all content. Use grep to match non-blanks an finally counting the resulting words and sort by highest count
```
cat README.md | tr "[:punct:][:space:]" "\n" | tr "[:upper:]" "[:lower:]" | grep . | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

Useful options:
+ `tr -d` delete characters
+ `tr -s` squeeze characters
