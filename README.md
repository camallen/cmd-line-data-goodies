Some example exercises using command line tools for data processing. Specifically tooling around data formatting and selection for cleaning / preparation for other analysis tools.

All exercises are in the examples directory and all these files rely on the data in data_files.

As always, use man pages for more information on any of the commands line tools in these examples, e.g. `man split`.

With thanks to https://medium.com/@kadek/command-line-tricks-for-data-scientists-c98e0abe5da as most of this was outrageously stolen.

And https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv for the sampel data
