#### What is this repo for?

This repo contains some example exercises that use command line tools for data processing. Specifically commands used to format and select data during cleaning and/or preparation for use in other analysis tools.

All exercises are listed in the [examples list](examples/index.md) and all these files rely on the data in data_files.

As always, use man pages for more information on any of the commands line tools in these examples, e.g. `man split`.

With thanks to https://medium.com/@kadek/command-line-tricks-for-data-scientists-c98e0abe5da as most of this was outrageously stolen.

And https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv for the sample data
